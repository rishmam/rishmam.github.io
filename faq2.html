			<h2><strong>I‚Äôm having a technical error!!</strong></h2>
      <p>Worry not - we‚Äôre here to help! Please use this form to report errors, and we will get back to you as soon as possible. We will extend registration for legitimate reasons. </p>
      <h2>The gender and/or sexuality I identify with is not here!</h2>
      <p>First and foremost, we apologize for the lack of representation in the survey choices. We strive to be inclusive, and are constantly looking for feedback and to improve, which you can submit here.
			</p>
			<h2>I'm an alum, so I no longer have a berkeley email - can I still participate? </h2>
			<p>This year, we are not allowing alumni to participate. Please check back next year for updates! </p>
			<h2>I‚Äôm having issues on mobile, or opening the website on messenger.</h2>
			<p>Sorry - please try using your computer, or just typing ‚Äúbearpairs.me‚Äù into the browser on your phone. In the case that you still encounter errors, please contact us.</p>
			<h2>I want to change some preferences or edit my survey responses. What do I do?</h2>
			<p>If you want to change your response to questions in the first section of the survey (basic info), please contact us, and we will adjust your answers accordingly! Otherwise - too bad.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="algorithm" id="algorithm">
      <h1> ü§îüíå </h1>
      <h2>What algorithm are you using? </h2>
      <p>Definitely nothing from CS 70. Nobel Prize-winning algorithms are for losers. And for us.</p>
      <h2>How accurate are the results?</h2>
      <p>This is our launching year, so if you take the survey (please do) you‚Äôll help us find out!</p>
			<h2>I don‚Äôt like my matches. Can I get new ones?</h2>
			<p>In one word: no. But also - do you like free food? If so, you can still schedule a 1-minute hang out to snag one of the great deals here! Otherwise, better luck next year.
</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="results" id="results">
      <h1> ü§îüíõ </h1>
      <h2>What will I know about my matches?</h2>
      <p>You will get basic info, social profiles they chose to share (that‚Äôs right - maybe you won‚Äôt have to go out of your way to find their LinkedIn!), a plethora of fun facts, and first date and restaurant preferences.
</p>
      <h2>What do I do after I receive my matches?</h2>
      <p> We provide a variety of perks for our matches. You can check them out here!</p>
			<h2>HOW DO I TALK TO MY MATCH?????</h2>
			<p>WORRY NOT!!!!! First check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2ezm3t/worst_possible_pickup_lines/">this</a> thread. Then, after realizing that you cannot do worse (or better?) than this, take a look at your match‚Äôs profile and try to find some common talking points! Otherwise, just ask if they want to get cheap food. You (combined with our discounts) can do this!
<p>
			<h2>What do you do with my results?</h2>
			<p>We anonymize your responses before running the algorithm; the only thing those on the team come into contact with, that are attached to your specific account, are your final results. We will never share your results with others outside of our team.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="misc" id="misc">
      <h1> ü§î‚õë </h1>
			<h2>How can I stay safe?</h2>
			<p>For your safety and for relevant resources, please refer to <a href="https://hingeapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007194774-Safe-Dating-Advice/">this</a> page before meeting with your matches.</p>
      <h2>I‚Äôm not a student at UC Berkeley. Can I still take the survey?</h2>
      <p>You can only take the survey if you have a berkeley email. Sorry!</p>
      <h2>Can I bring BearPairs to my campus?</h2>
      <p>!!! We are currently looking to expand to schools in the University of California system and beyond. If this applies to you, please contact us, and we‚Äôll work something out!</p>
